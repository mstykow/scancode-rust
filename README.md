Provenant is a fast, Rust-based code scanner for licenses, copyrights, package metadata, file metadata, and related provenance data, focused on correctness, safe static parsing, and native execution.

Provenant ports the [ScanCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit) engine to Rust and builds on it; on documented workloads it is typically well over 10× faster — and more on large repositories — while adding broader package and dependency extraction, lower-noise results, and CI-ready compliance gating. See [Why Provenant?](#why-provenant).

![Provenant and the reference scanner racing the same astral-sh/uv scan side by side](docs/provenant-demo.gif)

_The same [`astral-sh/uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) scan, identical flags (`--license --package`), one process each: Provenant finishes in seconds while the reference is still going. See the annotated [speed &amp; output-quality comparison](https://getprovenant.dev/compare/), or the full [benchmarks](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)._

## Quick Start

```sh
brew install getprovenant/tap/provenant
provenant scan --json-pp - --license --package /path/to/repo
```

Not on Homebrew (or on Windows)? `cargo install provenant-cli`, grab a [prebuilt archive](https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant/releases), or run the [container image](#container-image).

## Why Provenant?

- [Benchmark-backed](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) speed — well over 10× faster than the reference on same-host runs, and more on large repositories
- Package and dependency extraction across [many ecosystems](docs/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.md), reading manifests and lockfiles into structured package metadata and dependencies
- Complete SBOMs — SPDX and CycloneDX exports promote every resolved dependency to a component with a package URL and a closed dependency graph, not a packages-only summary that references materials it never lists; see real, verified examples in [`examples/sbom/`](examples/sbom/)
- Monorepo-aware inventories — workspace, reactor, and multiproject layouts (Cargo, npm/pnpm/yarn, Maven, Gradle, uv, Mix, Dart, and related) attribute nested sources and shared locks to the package that owns them
- Low-noise license and copyright detection — suppresses common false-positive classes such as code and prose bleed, and treats bare-word GPL/LGPL mentions as license clues; see [documented improvements](docs/improvements/README.md)
- CI license-compliance gating — policy severities with a build-failing [`--fail-on`](docs/CLI_GUIDE.md#17-i-want-policy-aware-license-review) gate and SARIF output for the code-scanning UI
- Source-faithful file-level copyright by default — accented names are kept as written (e.g. `Björn`, not ASCII-folded to `Bjorn`) and statements such as `All rights reserved.` aren't trimmed away
- Attested releases — every release binary and container image ships with [SLSA build-provenance attestation](https://slsa.dev), verifiable with `gh attestation verify`
- [Security-first](docs/adr/0004-security-first-parsing.md) static parsing — no execution of scanned code or package-manager code, with bounded resource use

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```sh
brew install getprovenant/tap/provenant
```

Installs a prebuilt `provenant` binary from the [Provenant tap](https://github.com/getprovenant/homebrew-tap); covers macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) and Linux (arm64 and x86_64).

### From Crates.io

Install the crates.io package `provenant-cli`:

```sh
cargo install provenant-cli
```

This installs the `provenant` command-line binary.

### Download Precompiled Binary

Download the release archive for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant/releases) page.

Extract the archive and place the binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

On Linux and macOS:

```sh
tar xzf provenant-*.tar.gz
sudo mv provenant /usr/local/bin/
```

On Windows, extract the `.zip` release and add `provenant.exe` to your `PATH`.

### Container Image

Prebuilt, statically linked multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are published to the GitHub Container Registry as [`ghcr.io/getprovenant/provenant`](https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant/pkgs/container/provenant), tagged with the full version (e.g. `0.2.5`), the `major.minor` series (e.g. `0.2`), and `latest`:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" ghcr.io/getprovenant/provenant:latest \
  scan /src --json-pp - --license --package
```

The image entrypoint is the `provenant` binary, so any CLI arguments can follow the image reference. To scan a project, mount it into the container and pass the mounted path as the scan target.

### Build from Source

For a normal source build, you only need the Rust toolchain:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant.git
cd provenant
cargo build --release
```

Cargo places the compiled binary under `target/release/`.

> **Note**: The binary includes a built-in compact license index. The `reference/scancode-toolkit/` submodule is only needed for developers updating the embedded license data, using maintainer commands that depend on it, or maintaining Provenant's built-in license dataset.

## Usage

### CLI Scanning

```sh
provenant scan --json-pp <FILE> [OPTIONS] <INPUT>...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Provenant requires at least one explicit output flag, such as `--json-pp -` or `--json scan-results.json`.

For the command tree, run:

```sh
provenant --help
```

For the complete scan-flag surface, run:

```sh
provenant scan --help
```

### Example

```sh
provenant scan --json-pp scan-results.json --license --package ~/projects/my-codebase --ignore "*.git*" --ignore "target/*" --ignore "node_modules/*"
```

Use `-` as `FILE` to write an output stream to stdout, for example `--json-pp -`.
Multiple output flags can be used in a single run.
When using `--from-json`, you can pass multiple JSON inputs. Native directory scans also support multiple input paths using common-prefix behavior.
For guided workflows, flag combinations, cache controls, and stdin-driven file lists, see the [CLI Guide](docs/CLI_GUIDE.md).

### GitHub Action

To run Provenant from a GitHub Actions workflow, use the
[`getprovenant/provenant-action`](https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant-action)
action, which wraps the published container image:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
- uses: getprovenant/provenant-action@v1
```

It can also **gate CI on a license policy** (`fail-on`) and upload **SARIF** findings to the code-scanning UI. See the [action README](https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant-action) for inputs and examples.

### HTTP Service

For the current service shell surface, run:

```sh
provenant serve --help
```

`provenant serve` runs Provenant as a long-lived HTTP service with warm process reuse, synchronous and asynchronous scan endpoints, and job polling for automation-friendly integrations.

For the HTTP request/response contract and examples, see the [Serve API Guide](docs/SERVE_API_GUIDE.md).

### Rust Library

If you want to embed Provenant in a Rust application instead of invoking the CLI, use the crates.io package `provenant-cli` and import the library target as `provenant`.

For the supported high-level Rust embedding path and dependency setup, see the [Library Guide](docs/LIBRARY_GUIDE.md).

## Output Formats

Implemented output formats include:

- JSON, including ScanCode-compatible output
- YAML
- JSON Lines
- Debian copyright
- SPDX, Tag-Value and RDF/XML
- CycloneDX, JSON and XML
- HTML report
- Custom template rendering (Jinja2-compatible, with a ScanCode compatibility context)

## Support and Acknowledgements

Provenant is an independent open source project. It was created by **Maxim Stykow** and **Adrian Braemer**, with [contributions from others](https://github.com/getprovenant/provenant/graphs/contributors). Its development has been made possible in substantial part by support from [TNG Technology Consulting GmbH](https://www.tngtech.com/), including paid contributor time on internal non-client work, compute and inference resources provided by TNG's internal GPU cluster, Skainet, and company-funded usage of third-party AI models. Without that support, Provenant would not have been possible in its current scope and form.

A substantial portion of Provenant's development has been contributed by people working on the project as TNG employees, and work on the project has been done both during TNG-supported work time and during personal unpaid time. For a fuller acknowledgement of project support, see [ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).
