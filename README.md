# Provenant

A Rust rewrite of [ScanCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit) for scanning codebases for licenses, package metadata, file metadata, and related provenance data.

## Overview

`Provenant` is built as a ScanCode-compatible alternative with a strong focus on correctness, feature parity, and safe static parsing.

Today the repository covers high-level scanning workflows for:

- License detection and ScanCode-style license-result output, with remaining license-reference parity tracked in [LICENSE_DETECTION_PLAN.md](docs/implementation-plans/text-detection/LICENSE_DETECTION_PLAN.md)
- Package and dependency metadata extraction across many ecosystems
- Package assembly for related manifests and lockfiles
- File metadata and scan environment metadata
- Optional copyright, holder, and author detection
- Optional email and URL extraction
- Multiple output formats, including ScanCode-style JSON, YAML, SPDX, CycloneDX, HTML, and custom templates

For architecture, supported formats, testing, and contributor guidance, start with the [Documentation Index](docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md).

## Features

- Single, self-contained binary
- Parallel scanning with native concurrency
- ScanCode-compatible JSON output and broad output-format support
- Broad package-manifest and lockfile coverage across many ecosystems
- Package assembly for sibling, nested, and workspace-style inputs
- Include and exclude filtering, path normalization, and scan-result filtering
- Persistent scan-cache controls for repeated runs
- Security-first parsing with explicit safeguards and compatibility-focused tradeoffs where needed

## Installation

### From Crates.io

Install the Provenant package from crates.io under the crate name `provenant-cli`:

```sh
cargo install provenant-cli
```

This installs the `provenant` binary.

### Download Precompiled Binary

Download the release archive for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mstykow/provenant/releases) page.

Extract the archive and place the binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

On Linux and macOS:

```sh
tar xzf provenant-*.tar.gz
sudo mv provenant /usr/local/bin/
```

On Windows, extract the `.zip` release and add `provenant.exe` to your `PATH`.

### Build from Source

For a normal source build, you only need the Rust toolchain:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mstykow/provenant.git
cd provenant
cargo build --release
```

Cargo places the compiled binary under `target/release/`.

> **Note**: The binary includes a built-in compact license index. The `reference/scancode-toolkit/` submodule is only needed for developers updating the embedded license data, working with helper scripts that depend on it, or using custom license rules.

## Usage

```sh
provenant --json-pp <FILE> [OPTIONS] <DIR_PATH>...
```

At least one output option is required.

For the complete CLI surface, run:

```sh
provenant --help
```

Commonly used options include:

- `--json`, `--json-pp`, `--json-lines`, `--yaml`, `--html`, `--csv`
- `--spdx-tv`, `--spdx-rdf`, `--cyclonedx`, `--cyclonedx-xml`
- `--custom-output`, `--custom-template`
- `--exclude/--ignore`, `--include`, `--max-depth`, `--processes`
- `--cache`, `--cache-dir`, `--cache-clear`, `--from-json`, `--no-assemble`
- `--filter-clues`, `--only-findings`, `--mark-source`
- `--license`, `--copyright`, `--email`, `--url`
- `--classify`, `--summary`, `--license-clarity-score`, `--tallies`
- `--tallies-key-files`, `--tallies-with-details`, `--facet`, `--tallies-by-facet`, `--generated`

### Example

```sh
provenant --json-pp scan-results.json ~/projects/my-codebase --ignore "*.git*" --ignore "target/*" --ignore "node_modules/*"
```

Use `-` as `FILE` to write an output stream to stdout, for example `--json-pp -`.
Multiple output flags can be used in a single run, matching ScanCode CLI behavior.
When using `--from-json`, you can pass multiple JSON inputs. Directory scan mode currently supports one input path.
Persistent caching is opt-in. Use `--cache scan-results`, `--cache license-index`, or
`--cache all` to enable cache kinds under one shared root. The cache root can also be controlled
with the `PROVENANT_CACHE` environment variable or `--cache-dir`.

For the generated package-format support matrix, see [Supported Formats](docs/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.md).

## Performance

`Provenant` is designed for efficient native scanning and parallel processing. See [Architecture: Performance Characteristics](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#performance-characteristics) for implementation details.

## Output Formats

Implemented output formats include:

- JSON, including ScanCode-compatible output
- YAML
- JSON Lines
- CSV
- SPDX, Tag-Value and RDF/XML
- CycloneDX, JSON and XML
- HTML report
- Custom template rendering

Additional parity-oriented outputs exist in the codebase, but this README focuses on the primary user-facing formats above.

Output architecture and compatibility approach are documented in:

- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Testing Strategy](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request.

A typical local setup on Linux, macOS, or WSL is:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mstykow/provenant.git
cd provenant
npm install
./setup.sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

The embedded license index is checked into the repository directly. Most contributors only need:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Use the generator only when intentionally refreshing embedded license data:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml --bin generate-index-artifact
```

If you use the repository's documentation and hook tooling, install the versions required by `package.json` and the project's `lefthook.yml` configuration. `npm install` fetches the pinned hook/docs tooling and installs hooks via the package `prepare` script; `npm run hooks:install` is available if you need to re-install them manually. Those setup and helper commands are currently shell-oriented, so Windows contributors should prefer running them inside WSL2.
