//! Region-aware suppression of copyright/holder/author false positives that
//! originate from the legal prose of a detected full license text.
//!
//! Copyright detection runs before license detection in the per-file pipeline,
//! so it has no view of which line ranges are license text and happily extracts
//! attribution-shaped fragments from license boilerplate (for example
//! `MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS`, `name of the author`, `Redistributions in binary
//! form`, or `Software Foundation` out of "Licensed to the Apache Software
//! Foundation"). ScanCode suppresses these because it is license-text-region
//! aware; this pass restores that behavior without reordering the pipeline.
//!
//! Once both detections have populated the [`FileInfo`], the line spans of
//! substantial license-body matches are known. The pass works in two steps:
//!
//! 1. A copyright entry inside such a region is dropped only when it has neither
//!    a real copyright-notice signal: a year, or a leading copyright marker
//!    (`Copyright`, `(c)`, `©`). A genuine notice begins with such a marker
//!    (`Copyright (c) Mort Bay Consulting Pty. Ltd.`), while license prose that
//!    merely mentions the word mid-sentence (`at the Copyright Holders option
//!    either a return of any price paid or`) does not, so the marker/year guard
//!    keeps real notices that sit at the top of (or inside) a LICENSE file.
//! 2. Holders and authors are normally anchored to the copyrights that survived
//!    step 1. Contact-backed authors are also kept: an explicit email is bounded
//!    authorship evidence and avoids dropping an `AUTHOR` section that happens to
//!    sit inside a coarse license match. Unanchored bare fragments such as `MAKE
//!    NO REPRESENTATIONS` or `...and its contributors` are still dropped.
