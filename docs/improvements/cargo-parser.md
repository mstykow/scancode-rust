# Cargo Parser Improvements

## Summary

Rust now goes beyond the released Python ScanCode Cargo handling in several concrete ways:

1. assigns ordinary crate files to their Cargo package instead of limiting ownership to `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`
2. proves workspace member file ownership for non-manifest files such as `LICENSE` and `README.md`
3. closes parser parity gaps around lowercase Cargo filenames and missing manifest fields like `readme` and `publish`
4. links manifest-declared files such as `readme` and `license-file` through explicit Cargo `file_references`
5. preserves per-dependency Cargo.lock provenance such as `source` and checksums

## Reference limitation

The Python reference covers the main Cargo surfaces, but package-wide file ownership, manifest-declared file references, and finer lockfile provenance remain incomplete.

## Rust Improvements

### Cargo package file ownership

- Plain Cargo crates now assign files under the crate root to the crate package, not only the manifest and lockfile.
- The assignment logic still skips `target/` and avoids stealing files from nested Cargo package roots.

### Workspace member ownership

- Cargo workspace member files like `crates/cli/LICENSE` and `crates/core/README.md` are now explicitly covered in assembly regression fixtures.
- This proves the member package assignment logic works for real non-manifest member files, not only `Cargo.toml`.

### Parser parity fixes

- `CargoParser::is_match()` now accepts lowercase `cargo.toml`.
- `CargoLockParser::is_match()` now accepts lowercase `cargo.lock`.
- Cargo.toml parsing now preserves:
  - `readme` as `extra_data.readme_file`
  - `publish` as `extra_data.publish`
- Cargo workspace readme inheritance markers are preserved in `extra_data` for downstream workspace-aware handling.
- Error-path fallback package data now keeps the correct Cargo `package_type` and `datasource_id` for both manifest and lockfile parsing.

### Manifest file references

- Cargo.toml now emits `file_references` for string-valued `license-file` and `readme` entries.
- These references are deduplicated and serialized as regular package file references, which makes downstream file-to-package linkage more useful without changing the underlying metadata fields.

### Lockfile provenance

- Cargo.lock dependency entries now preserve per-package `source` and `checksum` values in dependency `extra_data`.
- Annotated lockfile dependency strings such as `serde 1.0.228 (registry+...)` now normalize correctly to the pinned package version while still retaining provenance.
- Assembly goldens now prove that the hoisted Cargo.lock dependencies keep this provenance when manifest and lockfile data are merged.

## Why this matters

- **Better crate ownership**: Cargo packages can claim the files users expect, not just manifest files
- **Richer manifest provenance**: declared readme and license files become explicit package references
- **Better lockfile fidelity**: dependency source and checksum data remain available for downstream analysis
