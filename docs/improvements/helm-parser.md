# Helm Parser Improvements

## Summary

Rust now ships static Helm chart support for `Chart.yaml` and `Chart.lock` even though the Python ScanCode reference still has no production Helm parser.
The supported surface focuses on the high-value official metadata from Helm itself: chart identity, maintainers, declared chart dependencies, and pinned lockfile dependency state.

## Python Status

- Python ScanCode does not currently ship a Helm packagedcode parser.
- Upstream interest exists, but there is no packagedcode implementation or test suite to port directly.
- This gives Rust direct packagedcode support for Helm chart metadata that the Python reference does not currently provide.

## Rust Improvements

### Static `Chart.yaml` metadata extraction

- Rust now recognizes `Chart.yaml` and extracts chart identity from `name`, `version`, and `apiVersion`.
- The parser also preserves `description`, `home`, `keywords`, `maintainers`, and common Helm metadata such as `appVersion`, `kubeVersion`, `type`, `icon`, `sources`, and `annotations`.
- Root packages are emitted with Helm package identities such as `pkg:helm/nginx@22.1.1`.

### Declared dependency extraction from `Chart.yaml`

- Rust now extracts chart dependencies declared in `Chart.yaml`.
- It preserves dependency metadata including `repository`, `condition`, `tags`, `alias`, and `import-values`.
- Exact dependency versions are treated as pinned; range-style versions remain unpinned requirements.

### Pinned dependency state from `Chart.lock`

- Rust now parses `Chart.lock` for locked dependency versions.
- It preserves top-level lock metadata like `digest` and `generated`.
- Sibling assembly keeps both the declared dependency view from `Chart.yaml` and the pinned dependency view from `Chart.lock`, following the same manifest+lockfile pattern already used in Cargo and Composer.

## Guardrails

- Rust does **not** evaluate templates, parse `values.yaml`, fetch remote chart repositories, inspect packaged chart archives, or resolve charts from OCI registries.
- Legacy `apiVersion: v1` charts still have their core chart metadata parsed from `Chart.yaml`, but this supported surface does not implement `requirements.yaml` / `requirements.lock`.
- Malformed dependency entries are skipped instead of causing the whole chart parse to fail.

## Coverage

Coverage spans chart metadata extraction, declared and locked dependency handling, sibling assembly, malformed dependency tolerance, and the documented non-evaluating guardrails.
