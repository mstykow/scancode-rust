# Improvement: Stricter Surround Merge with Overlap Check

## Status: DEFERRED (This is an IMPROVEMENT, not a parity fix)

**This improvement is deferred.** It would fix CDDL rule selection by being STRICTER than Python, but the golden tests expect Python's exact behavior.

**The CDDL parity issue requires finding where Rust diverges from Python - this is a separate investigation.**

---

## Problem Statement

When scanning files that should match CDDL 1.0 rules, the Rust implementation incorrectly matches CDDL 1.1 rules instead.

### Manifestation in Golden Tests

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The issue is in the handling of `qspan_positions` when comparing matches with different position representation modes:

1. **CDDL 1.0 matches**: Have `qspan_positions: None` (contiguous range 18-270, 252 positions)
2. **CDDL 1.1 matches**: Have `qspan_positions: Some([...])` (174 scattered positions in range 0-270)

### Key Metrics from Investigation

**CDDL 1.0 (correct match)**:

- Coverage: 96.2%
- matched_length: 252 tokens
- hilen: 51
- start_token: 18, end_token: 270
- qspan_positions: None (contiguous)

**CDDL 1.1 (incorrect match)**:

- Coverage: 59.0%
- matched_length: 174 tokens
- hilen: 35
- start_token: 0, end_token: 270
- qspan_positions: Some(174 positions)

### Bug in `qoverlap()`

**Before fix**: Computed range overlap (252 tokens), treating all positions in [start, end) as matching.

**After fix**: Computes actual position overlap (164 tokens) by:

- Using set intersection when both have `qspan_positions`
- Checking each position against range when one has `qspan_positions` and the other doesn't

### Bug in `qcontains()`

**Before fix**: Used simple range containment (`start <= other.start && end >= other.end`), which incorrectly said CDDL 1.1 "contains" CDDL 1.0 because 0 <= 18 and 270 >= 270.

**After fix**: Uses set containment semantics matching Python's `Span.__contains__`:

- When one has positions and other has range, checks all positions against the range
- When both have positions, uses set intersection
- When both have ranges, uses range containment

---

## Proposed Fix (Diverges from Python)

### Root Cause #2: Incorrect Merge in `surround()` Check

After fixing `qcontains()` and `qoverlap()`, CDDL 1.0 was still being lost. The final bug was in `merge_overlapping_matches()` at lines 251-257:

**Problem**: The `surround()` check only verified that bounds surrounded, not that positions actually overlapped. CDDL 1.1 had two matches:

- m1: start=0, end=270, 174 scattered positions
- m2: start=18, end=143, 81 scattered positions

When `m1.surround(m2)` returned true (0 <= 18 && 270 >= 143), the code combined them, creating a false inflated match with 255 positions and 86.4% coverage, which then beat CDDL 1.0 in `filter_overlapping_matches()`.

**Fix**: Add `qoverlap > 0` check before merging surrounded matches:

```rust
if current.surround(&next) {
    let qoverlap = current.qoverlap(&next);
    if qoverlap > 0 {  // NEW: Only merge if positions actually overlap
        let combined = combine_matches(&current, &next);
        if combined.qspan().len() == combined.ispan().len() {
            rule_matches[i] = combined;
            rule_matches.remove(j);
            continue;
        }
    }
}
```

## Why This Diverges from Python

This fix matches the Python FIXME comment at `match.py:996`:

```python
# FIXME: qsurround is too weak. We want to check also isurround
```

Python has a known bug/limitation where `surround()` doesn't verify actual position overlap. The Rust fix would be **stricter** than Python, which could:

1. Cause different merge behavior in edge cases
2. Potentially fix bugs that Python hasn't fixed yet
3. Break golden test parity until Python is also fixed

---

## Files to Modify

1. `src/license_detection/models/license_match.rs`:
   - Fixed `qcontains()` to handle mixed `qspan_positions` cases ✓ (already done)
   - Fixed `qoverlap()` to compute actual position overlap ✓ (already done)

2. `src/license_detection/match_refine/merge.rs`:
   - Add `qoverlap > 0` check in `surround()` merge condition (NOT YET APPLIED)

---

## Implementation Status

**The `qcontains()` and `qoverlap()` fixes are applied.**

**The surround merge overlap check is NOT applied.**

Current state of `src/license_detection/match_refine/merge.rs`:

```rust
if current.surround(&next) {
    let combined = combine_matches(&current, &next);
    if combined.qspan().len() == combined.ispan().len() {
        rule_matches[i] = combined;
        rule_matches.remove(j);
        continue;
    }
}
```

**MISSING**: The `qoverlap > 0` check before merging surrounded matches.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this improvement:

1. Achieve parity with Python reference on all golden tests
2. Document that this fix diverges from Python intentionally
3. Consider upstreaming the fix to Python ScanCode

---

## Success Criteria

1. CDDL 1.0 test file produces `cddl-1.0 OR gpl-2.0` expression
2. CDDL 1.1 test file continues to produce correct CDDL 1.1 expression
3. All existing tests pass
4. No golden test regressions (or intentional divergence documented)
