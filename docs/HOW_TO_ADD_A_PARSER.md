# How To Add A Parser

This guide covers the parts of parser work that are specific to Provenant: parser invariants,
registration, datasource wiring, test expectations, and assembly/file-reference integration.

It intentionally does **not** repeat generic setup, Rust style, or broad testing workflow docs.
Use these as the source of truth for project-wide guidance:

- [`README.md`](../README.md) for local setup and hook installation
- [`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for test-layer definitions and command guidance
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for parser/assembly subsystem rationale
- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for contributor guardrails and repo conventions

## Parser workflow in this repo

Adding a parser usually means doing all of the following:

1. research the manifest or lockfile behavior you need to preserve
2. implement `src/parsers/<ecosystem>.rs`
3. register the parser in `src/parsers/mod.rs`
4. register parser metadata with `register_parser!`
5. add parser-local tests and, by default, parser goldens
6. classify every new `DatasourceId` for assembly accounting
7. add assembly or file-reference wiring when the ecosystem needs it
8. validate behavior against the Python reference or the authoritative format spec

## 1. Decide the parser surface before coding

Before you write code, answer these questions:

- Which concrete filenames or file patterns does this parser own?
- Is this one datasource or several distinct datasources handled by one parser?
- Does the format carry package identity, dependencies, declared-license metadata, or file
  references?
- Does the ecosystem need sibling/workspace assembly, or is it intentionally unassembled?
- If the Python ScanCode parser exists, what behavior and edge cases must be preserved?

If the ecosystem exists under `reference/scancode-toolkit/src/packagedcode/`, use the Python
implementation and tests as a **behavioral specification**. Use them to learn what the Rust parser
must do, not how to write it.

Collect representative fixtures early. At minimum, gather files that cover:

- a basic success case
- malformed or partially missing input
- dependency scope variations, if the format has them
- declared-license variations, if the format exposes them
- manifest/lockfile or file-reference cases, if downstream assembly depends on them

## 2. Implement the parser

Create `src/parsers/<ecosystem>.rs` and implement `PackageParser`.

Use the current parser contract from `src/parsers/mod.rs`, not an older string-based template:

```rust
use std::path::Path;

use crate::models::{DatasourceId, PackageData, PackageType};
use crate::parser_warn as warn;

use super::PackageParser;

pub struct MyParser;

impl PackageParser for MyParser {
    const PACKAGE_TYPE: PackageType = PackageType::Npm;

    fn is_match(path: &Path) -> bool {
        path.file_name().is_some_and(|name| name == "package.json")
    }

    fn extract_packages(path: &Path) -> Vec<PackageData> {
        match std::fs::read_to_string(path) {
            Ok(_content) => vec![PackageData {
                package_type: Some(Self::PACKAGE_TYPE),
                datasource_id: Some(DatasourceId::NpmPackageJson),
                ..Default::default()
            }],
            Err(error) => {
                warn!("Failed to read {:?}: {}", path, error);
                vec![PackageData {
                    package_type: Some(Self::PACKAGE_TYPE),
                    datasource_id: Some(DatasourceId::NpmPackageJson),
                    ..Default::default()
                }]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Parser invariants that matter here

- Set `datasource_id` on **every production path**, including error and fallback returns.
- Use `crate::parser_warn!` (typically imported as `warn`) for parser failures so diagnostics land
  in structured scan output.
- Do not use plain `log::warn!()` for file-scoped parser failures.
- Do not execute package-manager code or shell commands from parser logic **by default**.
- Do not do broad file-content license detection, copyright detection, or backfilling from sibling
  files inside the parser **by default**.
- Preserve raw dependency and license input when the source format is ambiguous.

Rare exceptions should stay rare, bounded, and documented:

- `swift_manifest_json.rs` may invoke `swift package dump-package` for raw `Package.swift`
  inputs because current SwiftPM manifest JSON generation requires manifest evaluation; pre-generated
  `Package.swift.json` remains the preferred static surface and graceful fallback is required.
- `python.rs` currently performs bounded sibling enrichment for adjacent installed/source metadata
  sidecars such as `requires.txt`, `RECORD`, `installed-files.txt`, `SOURCES.txt`, and sibling
  `WHEEL` files because those files are part of the same Python metadata surface. File ownership
  resolution still belongs in assembly (`src/assembly/file_ref_resolve.rs`), and new parsers should
  not copy this pattern unless an explicit assembly pass is genuinely infeasible.

### Declared-license contract

If the format exposes a **trustworthy declared-license surface** such as an SPDX-compatible manifest
field, populate:

- `extracted_license_statement`
- `declared_license_expression`
- `declared_license_expression_spdx`
- parser-side `license_detections`

Use the shared helper in `src/parsers/license_normalization.rs` instead of writing parser-specific
normalization logic.

If the license surface is weak or ambiguous, keep the parser raw-only:

- preserve `extracted_license_statement`
- leave declared-license fields empty
- do not emit guessed or partial expressions

### Dependency contract

- Populate `dependencies` whenever the format actually carries dependency data.
- Preserve the ecosystem's native scope terminology unless an existing parser pattern says
  otherwise.
- Treat parser tests and parser goldens as interface-contract checks for dependency fields, not just
  smoke tests.

### Parser metadata registration

Add `crate::register_parser!(...)` near the end of the parser file. This feeds
`docs/SUPPORTED_FORMATS.md` generation through `src/parsers/metadata.rs`.

```rust
crate::register_parser!(
    "npm package.json manifest",
    &["**/package.json"],
    "npm",
    "JavaScript",
    Some("https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json"),
);
```

If you skip this macro, the parser can still work at scan time, but it will be missing from the
generated supported-formats docs.

### Use existing parsers as templates

Prefer copying patterns from a nearby real parser over inventing a fresh structure. Good starting
points in this repo:

- `src/parsers/cargo.rs` for a manifest parser with declared-license normalization and dependencies
- `src/parsers/about.rs` for file-reference handling
- `src/parsers/npm.rs` or `src/parsers/python.rs` for more complex multi-surface ecosystems

## 3. Register the parser in `src/parsers/mod.rs`

You need both module wiring and scanner registration.

### Module wiring

Add the parser module and its test modules:

```rust
mod my_ecosystem;
#[cfg(test)]
mod my_ecosystem_test;
#[cfg(test)]
mod my_ecosystem_scan_test;

pub use self::my_ecosystem::MyEcosystemParser;
```

Match the test-module style used by neighboring parsers. Do **not** add per-parser golden modules
directly to `src/parsers/mod.rs`; this repo centralizes parser golden wiring in
`src/parsers/golden_test.rs`.

### Scanner registration

Add the parser to the `parsers:` list inside `register_package_handlers!`.

If the parser is not listed there, it will never be called by scanner dispatch even if the
implementation and tests compile.

You can verify registration with the parser-golden utility:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml --bin update-parser-golden -- --list
```

The parser should appear in that output after registration.

## 4. Add the tests this repo expects

### Unit tests

Add `src/parsers/<ecosystem>_test.rs` and cover the parser contract directly:

- `is_match()`
- basic extraction of package identity
- malformed or partial input
- dependency extraction and scope handling
- declared-license behavior when the format has a trustworthy license field
- any parser-specific edge case the reference implementation already handles

### Parser golden tests

For new production parsers in this repository, parser goldens are the default expectation.

Create `src/parsers/<ecosystem>_golden_test.rs`, follow the feature-gating pattern already used in
neighboring golden tests, and add representative fixtures under `testdata/<ecosystem>-golden/` or
the ecosystem-specific golden layout already used nearby.

After adding the file, register it in `src/parsers/golden_test.rs` with the same pattern used by
existing parsers:

```rust
#[path = "my_ecosystem_golden_test.rs"]
mod my_ecosystem_golden_test;
```

Use the parser-golden maintenance tool to generate expected output:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml --bin update-parser-golden -- --list
```

Then generate the exact expected files you need. See [`scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md)
and [`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for the current command patterns and golden-test
feature-gating.

### Parser-adjacent scan tests

Add `src/parsers/<ecosystem>_scan_test.rs` when parser correctness depends on scanner wiring,
assembly, or file/package linkage rather than single-file extraction alone.

Treat a scan test as effectively required when the parser emits meaningful downstream contract data,
including:

- package visibility after assembly
- `for_packages` links
- `datafile_paths`
- dependency hoisting or manifest/lockfile interaction
- `PackageData.file_references`

See `src/parsers/cargo_scan_test.rs` for a minimal example.

### Keep local verification scoped

This repo prefers narrow local validation. Do not treat broad commands as the default path from this
guide. Use [`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for the canonical test taxonomy and command
guidance, then run the smallest unit, golden, scan, or assembly target that proves the parser work.

## 5. Wire `DatasourceId` and assembly accounting

Every new file format needs a `DatasourceId`, and every new datasource must be accounted for in
assembly.

### Add datasource variants

Add the new `DatasourceId` variant or variants to `src/models/datasource_id.rs`.

Use one variant per concrete file format, not one variant per ecosystem. A manifest parser and a
lockfile parser usually need different datasource IDs.

### Classify every datasource

Edit `src/assembly/assemblers.rs` and do one of the following for every new datasource:

- add it to an `AssemblerConfig` when it participates in assembly
- add it to `UNASSEMBLED_DATASOURCE_IDS` when it is intentionally standalone

If you skip this, `test_every_datasource_id_is_accounted_for` will fail even if the parser itself
works.

### Add assembly config when needed

If the ecosystem has related manifest/lockfile or sibling metadata surfaces, add an
`AssemblerConfig` with the exact datasource IDs your parser emits.

Keep `sibling_file_patterns` aligned with the real filenames the scanner will see. The assembler can
only merge package data whose datasource IDs live in the same config.

If the ecosystem needs a brand-new post-assembly behavior rather than just a new datasource entry,
register that pass in `src/assembly/assemblers.rs` via `PostAssemblyPassKind` and
`POST_ASSEMBLY_PASSES`.

### File-reference resolution ownership

If the parser emits `PackageData.file_references`, you must also wire ownership of that resolution.

Register the datasource in `src/assembly/file_ref_resolve.rs` or another explicit post-assembly
pass, then add a parser-adjacent scan test proving the final scanned files link back to the package.

Without this, the parser can extract file references correctly while final scan results still fail
to attach those files to the package.

### Assembly goldens

If the ecosystem assembles multiple files into one logical package, add assembly fixtures under
`testdata/assembly-golden/<ecosystem>-basic/` and a matching test in
`src/assembly/assembly_golden_test.rs`.

Use assembly goldens to prove the final assembled package shape, not just parser extraction.

## 6. Validate behavior before calling the parser done

If a Python ScanCode parser exists, compare behavior against it. Validate at least:

- package identity fields
- dependency presence and scope
- declared-license output and raw statement preservation
- purl shape
- datasource IDs and assembly behavior
- file-reference linkage when applicable

If no Python reference exists, validate against the authoritative format spec and real-world
fixtures from that ecosystem.

If the Rust parser intentionally improves on the Python behavior, document the improvement briefly in
`docs/improvements/<ecosystem>-parser.md`. Keep that doc focused on the behavior difference, not as
an implementation diary.

## Common failure modes in this repo

- The parser compiles but never runs because it was not added to `register_package_handlers!`.
- `datasource_id` is set on the happy path but forgotten on parse-error or fallback returns.
- The parser uses `log::warn!()` instead of `parser_warn!()`, so scan diagnostics are lost.
- The parser guesses declared-license expressions from weak metadata instead of preserving raw input.
- Parser-only tests pass, but the real scanner output is wrong because the parser needed a
  `*_scan_test.rs`.
- The parser emits `file_references`, but no resolver ownership was added in assembly.
- `register_parser!` was skipped, so generated supported-formats docs never pick up the parser.

## Done definition

Before considering a new parser complete, make sure all of these are true:

- implementation exists in `src/parsers/<ecosystem>.rs`
- `datasource_id` is correct on every production path
- parser is exported and registered in `src/parsers/mod.rs`
- `register_parser!` metadata is present
- parser unit tests exist
- parser goldens exist unless an explicitly scoped follow-up is already planned
- parser-adjacent scan tests exist when downstream package or file-link behavior matters
- every new datasource is classified in `src/assembly/assemblers.rs`
- file-reference ownership is wired when the parser emits `PackageData.file_references`
- behavior has been validated against the Python reference or authoritative spec
